# AI Autonomous Agent (for Godot 4.5+)

**AI Autonomous Agent** is a powerful plugin that embeds an autonomous coding agent directly into the Godot Editor. Unlike simple chat wrappers, this agent has **agency**: it can read your project files, write code, list directories, and even check for syntax errors in your logs autonomously to complete complex tasks.

## Features

*   **Agency**: The agent can plan and execute multi-step tasks.
*   **File System Access**: Can list directories and read any file in your project.
*   **Code Writing**: Can create new scripts or modify existing ones.
*   **Syntax Checking**: Automatically verifies code for errors before finishing a task.
*   **Context Aware**: Knows it is working inside Godot 4.5+ and uses GDScript best practices.

## ⚠️ Important

*   **Full Access**: The agent has **complete control** over your project's file system, including the ability to **delete files and folders** if it deems necessary. **Always use version control (Git)** to safeguard your work.
*   **Model Recommendation**: To get the best results, use advanced APIs capable of complex reasoning ("thinking"). Simpler models may act "dumb" or fail to use tools correctly. We highly recommend using **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, which was used during testing.

## Installation and Use
